Exercise #1: FizzBuzz
Exercise #2: String Calculator
Exercise #3: Roman Numerals
Exercise #4: La La Landâ€¦ no wait, Moo Moo Moonlight

Rules: Write a function/program that takes a string containing only letters [A-Za-z], the three symbols that are common in every day sentences  .,' and spaces, and outputs the string in the style of La La Land.

To be more specific, take the letters up to, and including, the first vowel group, and print/output it twice adding a space each time, then print/output the whole string. y is a vowel in this challenge. Punctuation and capitalization should be kept.

You may assume that all strings contain at least one vowel, and that all strings start with a letter.
